## About The Project

• A website where a user can sign up for an account, and fully manage a to-do list with the ability to create, edit, and delete. In this project, I worked on the authentication system (sign up, log in, logout), Establish model relationships with CRUD operations. <br />
• Worked with authentication system where user can create a new account and login into it. <br />
• As sign up functionality added, only authenticated users can see their tasks. <br />
• User can select the important tag while creating a todo. So that that todo will stand out from other todos. <br />
